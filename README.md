# Neural-Net
I got fairly into some vaguely data science-y related stuff recently, and I wanted to actually understand how this stuff worked under the hood, so I'm doing it myself, no libraries, no nothing: just me, and good old _Racket_. No, this isn't finished either. I still have to fix the forward feed (I think my syntax is a bit off too) and actually do the backpropagation. Maybe check back in a bit!

Note: for now, the code only works for a set number of nodes and layers on a rather small dataset included directly in the code. I will (I should) make it work with an arbitrary number of nodes and on a user-given dataset.
